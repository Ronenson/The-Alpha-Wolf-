***Mother nature provides us with everything we need. Food, clothes, 
 shelter and resources as basic needs. What’s more, beautiful and
 charming sceneries, the flowers that appeal us by their charm and
 the animals that make us thrilled and fascinated. What will be 
 without them? Imagine it.***
 

***As for the animals, they are one of the children playing on the lap
 of mother nature. Every one of us has a favorite animal, don’t we? 
 As for me, it’s wolf.***

***Wolves are intensely ambitious and never shy from hard work. Socially
 adept, they function well in leadership and management roles as well
 as jobs requiring vision and strength of character. Being a natural
 motivator, their instinctive understanding of group dynamics serves
 them well in goal-oriented tasks.***

       

***However, the world is at stake now. We have hurt our mother nature in
 a way out of control. The image shows a truly deep meaning. We are just
 endangering ourselves.***

***Now mother nature wants to heal herself from the destruction caused to her.
 Whether it’s true or not mother nature is healing herself through coronavirus.
 Many of us may argue at this but I believe it’s true. Now the level of pollution
 all over the world has decreased to a great extent.***

***So what I want to convey is that while mother nature is healing herself, let’s 
 all try to be safe and to survive this wave. Once this is done, let’s not try
 to hurt mother nature in the best way we can for we don't know what she is capable of.***
